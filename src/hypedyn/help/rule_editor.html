	<p><h1>Rule editor</h1></p>
    
    <p>The rule editor displays the contents of a rule. Each rule has a name, and contains a list of <em>conditions</em>, and list of <em>actions</em>. Rules can be associated with links and nodes. The rule editor is the same for both link rules and node rules, the only difference being which actions are available in the rule.</p> 
    
	<p><img src="images/rule_editor.jpg" width=600 alt="Rule editor" /></p>
        
    <p>A rule may be renamed simply by editing the name in the text field at the top of the editor.</p>
    
	    <p><h4>Conditions</h4></p>
    
    <p>A condition can be selected by clicking on the condition, and unselected by either selecting another condition, or clicking again on the currently selected condition. The currently selected condition can be moved up or down in the condition list using the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons. </p>

    <p>Conditions can be added to a link by clicking on the <b>Add Condition</b> button in the toolbar. The new condition will be added after the currently selected condition, or at the end of the list if no condition is currently selected. The currently selected condition can be deleted by clicking on the <b>Delete Selected</b> button.</p> 

	<p><img src="images/conditions.jpg" width=600 alt="Conditions" /></p>

    <p>The type of condition, what the condition applies to, and the operator for the condition can all be changed by using the pulldown menus in the condition. Conditions can be applied to <em>nodes</em>, <em>links</em>, and <em>facts</em>. For nodes, the available operators are <em>visited</em>, <em>not visited</em>, <em>previous</em>, and <em>not previous</em>. For links, the available operators are <em>followed</em> and <em>not followed</em>. For more details about conditions on facts, please see the <a href="facts.html" title="Facts">Facts</a> section.
    
    <p><h4>Actions</h4></p>
    <!--
    Focus on actions:
    Show in popup is currently a bit broken
    Update text and update facts are discussed later
    When action on a link is triggered is a bit complex: text substitution is done when node is entered, whereas updating of facts and following of links is done when link is clicked
    -->

    <p>An action can be selected by clicking on the action, and unselected by either selecting another action, or clicking again on the currently selected action. The currently selected action can be moved up or down in the action list using the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons. </p>

    <p>Actions can be added to a link by clicking on the <b>Add action</b> button in the toolbar. The type of action added will correspond to the value selected in the pulldown menu to the right of the <b>Add action</b> button. The new action will be added after the currently selected action, or at the end of the list if no action is currently selected. The currently selected action can be deleted by clicking on the <b>Delete Selected</b> button.</p> 
    
	<p><img src="images/actions.jpg" width=600 alt="Actions" /></p>

    <p>The types of actions available include <em>Follow link to</em>, <em>Show in popup</em>, <em>Update text</em>, <em>Update fact</em>, and <em>Enable links to this node from anywhere</em>. <em>Follow link to</em> is activated when a link is clicked, and takes the reader to the specified node. <em>Show in popup</em> shows the specified node in a popup, overlaid on top of the current node. </p>
    <p><em>Update text</em> and <em> Update fact</em> will be discussed in the <a href="conditional_text.html" title="Conditional text">Conditional Text</a> and <a href="facts.html" title="Facts">Facts</a> sections. <em>Enable links to this node from anywhere</em> will be discussed in the <a href="anywhere_nodes.html" title="Anywhere Nodes">Anywhere Nodes</a> section. For node rules, the <em>Follow link to</em> and <em>Show in popup</em> actions are not available. <em>Enable links to this node from anywhere</em> is only available in node rules.</p>
<p><h4>Triggering rules</h4></p>
        
    <p>When a rule is triggered depends on whether it is associated with a link or a node, and what type of actions are contained in the rule. For node rules, all rules are triggered when a node is entered. For link rules, any rules containing <em>Follow link to</em>, <em>Show popup in</em> and <em>Update fact</em> actions are triggered when a link is clicked. Any rules containing the <em>Update text</em> action are triggered when a node is entered or refreshed. When a node is entered, node rules are triggered before link rules.</p>

    <p>When a rule is triggered, the conditions are evaluated in order. If the conditions are satisfied, then the actions are executed in order. The rule's conditions are considered to be satisfied if either <em>all</em> of the conditions are true, or <em>any</em> of the conditions are true, depending on the value selected in the pulldown menu above the condition list.</p>
